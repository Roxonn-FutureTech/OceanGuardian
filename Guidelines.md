Guidelines and instructions


This section will guide users on how to operate the robot effectively.
This section will be modified when the enough information gets known about the working  mechanism on which the robot identifies and collects the trash


1. Setup Instructions
1.1 Unboxing and Assembly
Unbox the Robot:

Carefully unbox the robot and ensure all components are present (chassis, motors, cameras, sensors, scoop mechanism, batteries, etc.).

Assemble the Chassis:

Attach the wheels or tracks to the chassis using the provided screws and tools.

Secure the motors to the chassis and connect them to the motor drivers.

Install the Scoop Mechanism:

Attach the scoop or conveyor system to the front of the robot.

Connect the scoop actuator (e.g., servo motor) to the control board.

Mount the Cameras and Sensors:

Attach the cameras to the front of the robot for trash detection.

Mount sensors (e.g., ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection) around the robot.

Connect the Electronics:

Connect the motors, cameras, sensors, and scoop actuator to the microcontroller (e.g., Raspberry Pi or Arduino).

Ensure all wiring is secure and tidy.

1.2 Software Setup
Install the Operating System:

Flash the Raspberry Pi with Raspberry Pi OS (if using Raspberry Pi).

Set up Wi-Fi and enable SSH for remote access.

Install Dependencies:

Install Python and required libraries (e.g., OpenCV, TensorFlow, NumPy):

bash
Copy
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
pip install opencv-python tensorflow numpy
Upload the Control Code:

Clone the robot’s control code from the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/2300030174/OceanGuardian.git
cd OceanGuardian
Run the main script to start the robot:

bash
Copy
python3 main.py
2. Operating the Robot
2.1 Powering On
Insert the Battery:

Insert the rechargeable battery into the designated compartment.

Ensure the battery is fully charged before use.

Turn On the Robot:

Press the power button to turn on the robot.

Wait for the system to boot up (indicated by a beep or LED light).

2.2 Calibration
Calibrate the Cameras:

Place the robot on a flat surface and run the camera calibration script:

bash
Copy
python3 calibrate_camera.py
Test the Motors:

Use the control script to test motor movements:

bash
Copy
python3 test_motors.py
Test the Scoop Mechanism:

Run the scoop test script to ensure it operates smoothly:

bash
Copy
python3 test_scoop.py
2.3 Operating Modes
Autonomous Mode:

Place the robot on the beach and activate autonomous mode:

bash
Copy
python3 autonomous_mode.py
The robot will start detecting trash and collecting it using the scoop.

Manual Mode:

Use a remote control or mobile app to manually operate the robot.

Follow the app’s instructions for movement and scoop control.

Data Collection Mode:

Activate data collection mode to log trash detection and navigation data:

bash
Copy
python3 data_collection_mode.py
3. Maintenance Instructions
3.1 Routine Maintenance
Cleaning:

After each use, clean the robot to remove sand, salt, and debris.

Use a soft brush and damp cloth to clean the chassis, wheels, and scoop.

Battery Care:

Recharge the battery after each use.

Store the battery in a cool, dry place.

Inspect Components:

Regularly check the motors, sensors, and scoop mechanism for wear and tear.

Tighten any loose screws or connections.

3.2 Troubleshooting
Robot Not Moving:

Check the motor connections and battery level.

Run the motor test script to diagnose the issue.

Camera Not Detecting Trash:

Ensure the camera is properly connected and calibrated.

Clean the camera lens and check for obstructions.

Scoop Not Working:

Inspect the scoop actuator and connections.

Run the scoop test script to identify the problem.

4. Data Collection Practices
4.1 Collecting Data
Enable Data Collection:

Activate data collection mode using the control script.

View Collected Data:

Access the data logs stored on the robot (e.g., in the /data directory).

Upload Data:

Upload the data to a cloud platform for analysis (optional).

4.2 Analyzing Data
Trash Detection Data:

Use the collected images and GPS coordinates to analyze trash distribution.

Navigation Data:

Analyze the robot’s paths and obstacles to improve navigation algorithms.

5. Community Engagement
5.1 Contributing to the Project
Report Issues:

Use the GitHub Issues page to report bugs or suggest improvements.

Submit Pull Requests:

Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

Join the Community:

Participate in discussions on the project’s forum or Discord server.

5.2 Sharing Feedback
Provide Feedback:

Share your experiences and suggestions with the community.

Organize Events:

Host beach clean-up events or workshops to promote the project.

6. Safety Guidelines
Always operate the robot in a safe environment.

Keep the robot away from water unless it’s waterproof.

Do not touch moving parts while the robot is in operation.
